Differences between 3G and 4G?

3G and 4G are both networks that connect your deviceto the internet. 
The “G” in each stands for generation.
As it is with most techy things, the larger number indicates the newer, better version of a particular technology.
Obviously there are some in-depth technology differences.
4G is often up to 10x faster than 3G in real-world use – with speeds commonly between 20Mbps and 50Mbps
but However, this speed will fluctuate depending on how far you are from a network tower and on the power of the radios inside your phone. 
On the other hand, there's no down-side to using 4G instead of 3G, other than that it uses a tiny bit more of your phone's battery.
Which Expensive? Not at all.telecumeration companies networks all offer a combination of 3G and 4G service and there is no extra charge for the faster speeds.

After 5G?

5G is the next major evolution in mobile network technology, and we'll start to see the first 5G enabled devices launch this year. As with 4G before it, 5G is focused on mobile data. 
Faster network speeds: 5G networks will be capable of download speeds as fast as 20Gbps. The exact speeds an individual will get will depend on a number of factors, but the 5G specification states that individual users should see minimum download speeds of 100Mbps. 
Lower latency:latency is perhaps best described as the time it takes information to get from your phone to the wider internet and back again. The typical latency for a 4G network is around 60 milliseconds, whereas 5G could decrease this to as low as 1 millisecond.Example: self-driving cars,...
More simultaneous connections: 5G will allow more devices to connect to the network at the same time. Example: autonomous cars, connected machinery, and Internet of Things devices.
